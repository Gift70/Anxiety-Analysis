Anxiety Attack Analysis

TECHNOLOGIES USED

Tool: Excel

INTRODUCTION

Anxiety goes beyond the mind, it affects the body, It’s shaped by lifestyle choices, and can be managed with the right approach. This analysis explores key links between anxiety severity and physiological responses, physical activity, sleep, stress, and substance use.


While correlation doesn’t equal causation, these insights offer practical strategies for understanding and managing anxiety.


OVERVIEW

This dataset includes:

Demographics: Age, gender, employment status

Lifestyle factors: Alcohol & caffeine consumption

Physical symptoms: Sweating, dizziness, heart rate changes

Therapeutic strategies: Therapy sessions and effectiveness


KEY INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS:

Age, Profession and Anxiety:

Anxiety is not evenly distributed across all age groups and professions.

•	The highest anxiety prevalence is recorded among individuals aged 33-42, with 1,325 reported cases.

•	Doctors and unemployed individuals report significantly higher anxiety severity than other groups, possibly due to financial stress, toxic environments or career uncertainty.



SLEEP & ANXIETY:

Those sleeping less than 5 hours per night report higher anxiety scores.

Surprisingly, anxiety also increases when sleep exceeds 9 hours per night, potentially due to depression or chronic fatigue.



RECOMMENDATIONS:

•	Aim for 7–8 hours of quality sleep per night.

•	Reduce screen time before bed, avoid caffeine in the evening, and establish a bedtime routine.

•	If sleep disturbances persist, consider cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) or medical consultation.



STRESS & ANXIETY:

Higher stress levels strongly correlate with anxiety severity.

Some individuals manage moderate stress without high anxiety, suggesting that coping mechanisms matter.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

•	Identify personal stress triggers and implement daily stress-reducing habits (journaling, progressive muscle relaxation).

•	Strengthening social support systems by connecting with family, friends, or support groups can buffer stress.

•	Try time management techniques to reduce overwhelming workloads.



PHYSICAL ACTIVITY & ANXIETY:

Low physical activity correlates with higher anxiety, but increased exercise doesn’t always reduce anxiety significantly.

Other factors, such as sleep and stress management, appear to have a stronger influence.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

•	Regular exercise (even low-intensity activities like walking or yoga) can support anxiety management.

•	Balance exercise with rest.

•	Pair physical activity with mental health strategies (journaling, therapy, mindfulness).



ANXIETY & PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE: 

Increased heart rate and breathing rate are common during severe anxiety, reinforcing the fight or flight response theory.

Some cases show lower than expected heart rates, suggesting a freeze response instead.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

•	Practice breathing control techniques (diaphragmatic breathing, box breathing) to regulate physical symptoms.

•	Engage in mindfulness or meditation to lower the body’s stress response.


ALCOHOL, CAFFEINE & ANXIETY:

Heavy alcohol use (6+ drinks per week) is linked to higher anxiety, though abstainers also report elevated anxiety, suggesting some use alcohol as a coping mechanism.

Higher caffeine consumption (8-10 mg/day) is mildly correlated with increased anxiety, likely due to stimulant effects on the nervous system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

•	Limit caffeine intake if you experience jittering, racing thoughts, or restlessness.

•	Reduce alcohol consumption, especially if used as a coping mechanism. Opt for healthy alternatives like herbal teas.

•	If reducing intake worsens anxiety, explore underlying psychological dependencies with a professional.



PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS & ANXIETY:

Sweating and dizziness are among the most reported physical symptoms in anxiety cases.

Hyperventilation or changes in blood pressure might contribute to these effects.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

•	Learn to identify early signs of anxiety and implement grounding techniques.

•	Hydration & nutrition: dehydration and low blood sugar can worsen dizziness meanwhile, maintaining balanced nutrition helps.

•	If symptoms are frequent, seek medical advice.



THERAPY & ANXIETY:

Anxiety severity gradually decreases with more therapy sessions, but not in all cases.

Therapy alone might not be enough, a combination approach seems to work best.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

•	Explore different therapy approaches (CBT, exposure therapy, mindfulness-based therapy).

•	If therapy alone isn't effective, consider combining it with medication or lifestyle changes.

•	Regular therapy does help in most cases, so sticking with sessions is key.



ACTIONABLE STEPS:

✅ Prioritize Sleep & Stress Management.

✅ Physical exercise is beneficial, but it should be part of a broader mental health strategy. Pair it with good sleep, relaxation techniques, and therapy.

✅ Monitor Your Body’s Responses because recognizing symptoms like racing heart, dizziness, and sweating can help implement early coping strategies before anxiety escalates.

✅ While some turn to caffeine and alcohol as coping mechanisms, these can sometimes anxiety symptoms. Cutting back might offer unexpected relief.

✅ Therapy alone may not be a universal solution but combining it with sleep hygiene, stress reduction, and healthy coping strategies leads to better results.


CONCLUSION:

This analysis debunks the myth that anxiety is purely psychological, it has clear links to lifestyle, occupation, and physical health. By understanding these factors, we can move toward better prevention, intervention, and support systems.
